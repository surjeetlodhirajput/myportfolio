    I'm enthusiastic about tech in coding and learning new things about computers and what they can do. I've been dabbling with coding since roughly age of 18, until I started studying computer science at university at 19 where my interest really peaked. Take a peek at the projects I have done, or jump straight to my <a href="https://github.com/surjeetlodhirajput">github</a>. When I have time over I sometimes  answer questions in forums and helping people with code.
  <br><br>  Other than coding I enjoy tinkering with computers and my homelab.I also love to attended hackathons where people and code meet togheter to solve solutions in a hastly manner.
